# ipccutils
Description:
------------
This module provides utility functions to generate scientific plots styled 
according to IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) visual standards.
It includes predefined color themes, colormap management tools, spine trimming, 
colorbar utilities, and high-level Cartopy-based map plotting routines.



The ipcccutils library I am calling a “package” in quotes because it currently has the core structure of any package you would install using conda or pip; there is an __init__.py file that allows you to access all of the library’s modules and the functions within, using a single from pathlib import Path

from ipccutils import * command. However, this “package” is not available through conda or pip yet. In the meantime, you can get the package by cloning the repo.
